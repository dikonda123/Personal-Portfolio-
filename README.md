*DESCRIPTION*:Creating a personal portfolio website is a fundamental and effective way for any developer to showcase their skills, projects, and contact information in a professional and accessible format. The basic developer portfolio described here is built using core web technologies and designed for simplicity, responsiveness, and clarity.

Tools Used
This portfolio website was developed using the following tools and technologies:

HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language): Used as the structural foundation of the website. HTML is responsible for organizing the content into semantic sections like headers, sections, footers, and project blocks.

CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used for styling the web pages. It handles everything from colors and fonts to layout and responsiveness. The CSS file ensures the site has a clean, modern look and works well across devices.

Text Editor: A code editor such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text is typically used to write and manage the HTML and CSS files.

Browser Developer Tools: Modern browsers provide tools for testing and debugging the website during development, which helps refine layout and responsiveness.

Key Features
Responsive Layout:
The layout is designed to adapt to various screen sizes, making the site accessible on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The use of relative units and a mobile-friendly structure ensures it remains usable on different devices.

Structured Sections:

Header: Contains the developer’s name and a navigation menu with anchor links for smooth scrolling.

Hero Section: A brief introduction with a welcoming message and the developer’s role.

About Section: Describes the developer’s background, skills, and approach to web development.

Projects Section: Displays multiple projects with titles, brief descriptions, and external links to view more.

Contact Section: Provides essential contact details including email and GitHub profile.

Footer: A simple footer with copyright.

Clean UI/UX:
The design uses clear typography, white space, and a limited color palette for readability and professionalism. Users can easily navigate between sections using the header menu.

Easy Customization:
As it uses basic HTML and CSS, the code is easy to modify and expand. Developers can add more sections like skills, resume download, or blog links as their portfolio grows.

No Dependencies:
This project does not rely on external frameworks or libraries like Bootstrap or JavaScript (although they can be added later). This makes it lightweight and beginner-friendly.

Conclusion
This basic portfolio website provides a strong starting point for any developer looking to establish an online presence. It demonstrates the developer's ability to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing site using only HTML and CSS, making it ideal for beginners and intermediate developers. By showcasing projects, personal information, and contact links in a clear format, it serves as a digital resume and a hub for future employers or collaborators to learn more about the developer’s work. With minimal effort, the site can be enhanced with animations, dark mode, JavaScript interactions, or backend integrations, allowing it to grow as the developer's skill set evolves.
